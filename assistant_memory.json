If you don't know it, use \"Dear Clan Member,\" but using their name is better.\n*   **[Clan Name]:** Fill in the name of your clan.\n*   **Tone:** Choose the option that best reflects your clan's communication style. Some clans are more blunt than others.\n*   **Feedback:** If you gave the player specific feedback previously, you can briefly mention that.\n*   **Alternative Clans:**  *If appropriate*, you could suggest lower-level clans where they might be a better fit (but only if you genuinely think it would be helpful).\n*   **Reason (Optional):** While I included \"gameplay performance\" as the reason, you could be slightly more specific if you want (e.g., \"missed attacks in war,\" \"low donation rate,\" etc.), but keep it brief.  Be careful about getting into a long, critical explanation.\n*   **\"Sincerely, Your AI Assistant\":**  This is intended to be a bit of a novelty. You can change it to something more standard (e.g., \"Sincerely, The Clan Leadership,\"  \"Sincerely, [Your Name]\",  \"Sincerely, [Clan Name] Leadership\").  If you are actually an AI, then it makes sense.  If you're a human pretending to be an AI, maybe reconsider.\n\nI recommend choosing the option that is most honest and clear while still being respectful. Being vague can lead to more confusion and hurt feelings.\n"

Using a name is more personal and professional than \"Dear Sir/Madam.\"\n*   **\"We are delighted...\"**: A polite and enthusiastic opening.\n*   **\"Prestigious event...\"**: Highlights the importance of the World Cup.\n*   **\"Thrilling matches, unforgettable atmosphere\"**: Briefly mentions key benefits of attending.\n*   **\"[Link to Website/Information]\"**: This is absolutely essential! Provide a direct link where people can find more information. Replace \"[Link to Website/Information]\" with the actual URL.\n*   **\"We encourage you...\"**: Polite call to action.\n*   **\"We hope to see you there\"**: A positive and friendly closing remark.\n*   **\"Sincerely, Your AI Assistant\"**: Maintains the specified tone and closing.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Replace the Placeholder:**  The email is useless without replacing \"[Recipient Name]\" and \"[Link to Website/Information]\".\n*   **Target Audience:**  Consider your target audience when choosing slightly different wording. Is it a formal invitation or a more casual announcement?\n*   **Customize Further:** If this invitation is for a specific match or a hospitality package, tailor the email to include those details.  This generic invitation needs more specific information to be truly useful.\n"

Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n*   **Domesticated:** Cows have been bred and raised by humans for thousands of years for various purposes.\n\n*   **Female Bovine:** This means they are the female of the species *Bos taurus* (or sometimes other closely related species).  Bovine refers to the biological family Bovidae, which includes cattle, buffalo, bison, and other similar animals.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n\n*   **Herbivores:** Cows are herbivores, meaning their diet consists primarily of plants, especially grasses.\n\n*   **Ruminants:** They are ruminants, which means they have a specialized digestive system with four compartments to help them break down tough plant matter. They regurgitate and re-chew partially digested food (cud).\n\n*   **Milk Production:** Female cows (after giving birth to a calf) are often raised for milk production. Different breeds are specifically bred for higher milk yields.\n\n*   **Meat Production (Beef):** Cows (and other cattle) are also raised for meat production, known as beef.\n\n*   **Other Uses:**  Cows can also be used for leather, and in some cultures, they are used as draft animals (for pulling carts or plows).\n\n**Important Terms:**\n\n*   **Bull:** An adult male bovine animal.\n\n*   **Calf:** A young bovine animal (male or female).\n\n*   **Heifer:** A young female bovine animal that has not yet had a calf.\n\n*   **Steer:** A male bovine animal that has been castrated.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nA cow is a female domesticated bovine animal, primarily raised for milk and/or meat production. They are herbivores with a complex digestive system (ruminants) and play a significant role in agriculture and human societies around the world.\n\nDo you want to know more about a specific aspect of cows, such as different breeds, their diet, or their role in agriculture? Let me know!\n"
